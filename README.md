# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
#Program to to find the Exponentiation of a number.
#Developed by: K.Sangeetha
#RegisterNumber: 21500118
def exponentiation():
    a=int(input())
    b=(a**2)
    print("Exponentiation of a given number:",b)
exponentiation()
```

## Output:
![exponentiation of a number](expo.png)
![exponentiation of a number](output.png)

## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
